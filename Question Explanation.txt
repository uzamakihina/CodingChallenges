DIFFERENT NUMBER SYSTEMS     - We take a number from a number system, with the following input, and output the same value
in the third provided system. 
For example:
"18" "0123456789" "01" the output should be 100100
Or 
"!##" "#!@" "0123456789" the output should be 8




PANCAKE FLIPPER     - given a string line of "-" and "+" and a flipper size (n), we can only flip n consecutive pancakes at a time.
When a "+" is flipped it becomes a "-" and vice versa.
Try to flip the pancakes in the least amount of flips so so all the characters are "+" and display the amount of flips.
If this cannot be done then say its impossible.




FIBJUMP     - given a path starting from block [0] and ending at block[n], n being a user input size, such that there are n + 1
blocks where the block platform number is block%2. A block is either landable (1) or unlandable(0) 
with the last and first block always being landable.
You can only jump on blocks that are landable. 
What is the least amount of jumps you need to get from block [0] to block [n] assuming you can 
only do a jump the size of one of the numbers in the fibonacci sequence.




LONGEST SENTENCE -   Given a paragraph find the sentence with the most amount
of words, assuming all sentences are separated by either . or ! or ?

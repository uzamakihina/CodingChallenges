DIFFERENT NUMBER SYSTEMS - We take a number from a number system, with the following input and output the same value
in the third provided system. 
For example:
"18" "0123456789" "01" the output should be 100100
Or 
"!##" "#!@" "0123456789" the output should be 8

PANCAKE FLIPPER - given a line of "-" and "+" and a flipper size (n), we can only flip n consecutive pancakes at a time.
When a "+" is flipped it becomes a "-" and vice verse.
Try to flip the line so all the characters are "+", if impossible then claim it.

FIBJUMP - given a path starting from block [0] and ending at block[n], n being a user input size, such that there are n 
blocks+1 that alternate from being landable (1) or unlandable(0) with the last and first block always being landable.
You can only jump on blocks that are landable. What is the least amount of 
jumps you need to get from block [0] to block [n] assuming you can only do a jump the size of one of the numbers in the 
fibonacci sequence.
